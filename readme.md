## Project goal
Rummikub is a game written for the Python Programming course. The goal of the project was to create game logic, gui and a websocket-based communication interface so that players could play from **multiple devices simultaneously seeing everyone's moves in real time**. The game was developed entirely in Python, using the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/) graphics library.
